## About Me

I’m a passionate learner combining my interests in **water quality management, wastewater treatment & reuse** with cutting-edge technologies. Currently, I’m advancing my skills in **software engineering** through the Power Learn Project (PLP), focusing on frontend & backend development, mobile apps, and AI.  

I enjoy integrating **IoT, remote sensing, and machine learning** into sustainable irrigation and smart water management systems that improve efficiency and resilience. I also practice **graphic design**, which allows me to express creativity and design intuitive interfaces.  

I align my passion with the United Nations’ **SDG 6: Clean Water & Sanitation**, contributing to innovations that make clean and safe water accessible for all.
